- Some examples of how we might go about running a Luminesce background query in Python
- Steps:
  - Follow instructions here: `https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/`, ie:
    - In this directory, run: `python3 -m venv venv`.
      - This makes a virtual envt called 'venv' at the top level
    - Then: `source venv/bin/activate`
    - Then: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` and `python3 -m pip install luminesce-sdk`
    - Alternatively install/check against the `requirements.txt` file
  - Then rename secrets_template.json to `secrets.json` and replace `<domain>` and `<your-token-here>` with the domain and PAT of a user.

- The main file is background_query_setup.py. This has all the logic
- Other files use `background_query_setup` as a module and just generate specific sql to be run
- Then run eg: `python3 parse_error_query_example.py` or `python3 successful_query_example.py`
