## Automated testing

We run automated tests on the SQL files in this project via GitHub Actions. You can see the `.github/workflows`
directory for more details.

Many of our tests require setup data. To create this data, we have setup a process whereby the testing runner
will search for a `_data` directory wherever it finds `.sql` files. Then, two things happen:

1. If there are data files in the `_data` directory, the runner will upload these to a `luminesce-examples` folder in
LUSID Drive
2. If there is a `setup.py` file in this directory, the runner will run the `setup.py` file. We use this `setup.py`
file to configure recipes and other configurations we don't want to setup via Luminesce.
