## Run using Docker 

You can run with docker as follows.

Build the image:

```
docker build . -t luminesce-examples-runner
```

Run a container by passing auth credentials as environment variables:

```
docker run \
-e FBN_LUSID_API_URL=<API_URL> \
-e FBN_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> \
-e FBN_APP_NAME=<APP_NAME> \
-e FBN_USERNAME=<USERNAME> \
-e FBN_CLIENT_SECRET=<CLIENT_SECRET> \
-e FBN_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID> \
-e FBN_TOKEN_URL=<TOKEN_URL> \
-e FBN_DRIVE_API_URL=<DRIVE_URL> \
-e FBN_LUMI_API_URL=<LUMI_URL> \
luminesce-examples-runner -start_dir=examples/drive
```

## Running locally

You can run one or more of these examples locally by using the `--secrets` and `--start_dir` parameters.

For example, to run the Drive examples only:

```
python runner/run.py --secrets=secrets/secrets.json --start_dir=examples/drive
```

You can also choose to keep the sample Drive files created by the runner:

```
python runner/run.py --secrets=secrets/secrets.json --start_dir=examples/drive --keepfiles
```

## Automated testing

We run automated tests on the SQL files in this project via GitHub Actions. The configurtion for these tests live in the `.github/workflows`
directory.

Many of our tests require setup data. To create this data, there is a process where the testing <b>runner</b>
will search for a `_data` directory wherever it finds `.sql` files. Then, two things happen:

1. If there are data files in the `_data` directory, the runner will upload these to a `luminesce-examples` folder in
LUSID Drive
2. If there is a `setup.py` file in this directory, the runner will run the `setup.py` file. We use this `setup.py`
file to configure recipes and other configurations we don't want to setup via Luminesce.

Sample structure below:

```
upload_equity_instruments.sql
upload_bond_instruments.sql
_data
    eq_instruments.csv
    instruments.txt
    setup.py
```
