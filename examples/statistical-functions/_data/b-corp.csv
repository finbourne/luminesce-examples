The majority of our coffee is sourced through direct trade. They foster long term partnerships directly with coffee producers around the world; We have a shared responsibility for sustainable practices and to give the end drinker full traceability of what’s in their cup.

Now the top-selling brand of organic & fair trade bodycare in the U.S., Dr. Bronner’s was founded in 1948 by Emanuel Bronner, a third-generation master soapmaker from a German-Jewish soapmaking family.

A multi-faceted creative consultancy for people and planet, Ecocreative specialises in strategy, design and communications aimed at engaging the community. To establish the best opportunity for successful outcomes, Ecocreative works closely with leaders and decision-makers to better align action with organisational values.

Equal parts sustainable design studio, strategic advisory service, communications consultancy, engagement facilitator, problem solver and think tank, Ecocreative operates as a change agent. Ecocreative’s depth of experience, knowledge and impressive networks help organisations in the government, business and community sectors navigate, communicate and innovate with confidence. 

Since 1998, a defining characteristic of Ecocreative has been the ability to tackle serious issues without losing sight of the intrinsic pleasure of working with people who share a common purpose. Their holistic approach to sustainability considers that the way a business operates is at least as important as the work itself.

To this end, Ecocreative’s policy every day is to create ethically, consume responsibly, waste nothing, and share everything they can. Being a B Corp provides a welcome framework that allows them to help others who are advocating for positive change.The Change We Seek	

However it’s defined, Ecocreative believes sustainability isn’t an end point – it’s a philosophy, a set of values in action. The change Ecocreative seeks isn’t just about the environment (as vital as that is), it’s also about vibrant communities and how we all make a fair living.

Last millennium it seemed like we had to make a choice between profit or planet, economics or ecosystems. Now, an approach to doing things responsibly is widely accepted as best practice. 

We choose to work with clients who share our philosophy and engage with a network of collaborators who appreciate why it is so important. As a B Corp, Ecocreative can only see this movement broadening and accelerating.

John Li and Jeffrey Zhou were determined to create a model of responsible lending. A model that would align business returns with the financial health of the borrower.
 
Today, Fig Loans does exactly that. Fig maximizes their profit by building up the financial health of their customers. Their model starts with the Fig Loan, a socially responsible alternative to predatory payday loans that was designed in collaboration with United Way of Houston and incorporates the CFPB’s small dollar lending remedies. The loan serves as an entry point and naturally transitions into a longer-term credit building product.

In the short term, Fig provides a socially responsible, credit building alternative to payday loans. In the long term, Fig helps improve consumers’ financial health by building their credit up so they can access affordable mainstream credit products. In this way, Fig offers Americans with bad credit a second chance to rebuild credit and regain access to traditional credit products.",Other credit - Developed Markets,Financial & insurance activities,Socially Responsible Lender for the Underbanked,United States,Texas,Houston,Service with Minor Environmental Footprint, 1-9,bcorporation.net/directory/fig-loans,www.figloans.com,2017,88.2,20.8,31.3,2.3,13.5,11.1,0.8,3.6,0.5,0,0.7,1.8,,,,7.2,,2.3,,7,,,,,,2.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.1,0.5,,,,,1.1,0,,,,30,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0.6,,0.5,,,,1.1,,,,,,,,2.2,,,,4,2.5,4.5,0.6,,4,,,,,,2.7,,0.4,,0,3.2,,1

They use an innovative structure to do something no one has ever done before: Offer expert, high-quality legal advice to any American with a serious need — for free.

An immigrant seeking to grow her family. Some of these folks are rural and low-income; others are wealthy and well-educated.

They take pride in their amazing local team of over 250 people. In less than 6 years they have managed to grow and become the largest bus company in Benin. While entrepreneurship is underdeveloped in risk averse cultures, they showed that it can be an opportunity for growth. 

In 2013 they began by servicing a few lines, and now they are the largest bus company and the only one with national coverage. 

They choose to not only serve lines with the most profit potential, but also to ensure that there are lines connecting communities where these services are scarce. And this has become their competitive advantage: they have learned to run efficient and profitable service on lines that are economically less attractive by embedding them in an effective national network.

To do so, Baobab operates a fleet of 24 comfortable buses, connecting all destinations across Benin.

Despite having one of the best conditions for rice growing, the Myanmar rice sector has one of the lowest yields by global standards. This is because the Myanmar rice sector is highly fragmented, made up of smallholder farmers who grow their crops independently of each other and do not achieve economies of scale. This is further perpetuated by poor farming methods and high intermediary costs, trapping whole farming communities in a poverty cycle. 

Value Proposition 
Golden Sunland collaborates with Myanmar smallholder farmers as an aggregator, to steward and streamline the value chain, from seed, to harvest, to table. 

Progressive Solution

Reboxed is here to change that.

Reboxed is a start-up based in South London on a mission to help tackle the e-waste crisis by rehoming 100 million devices by 2030.

Reboxed also runs a donation programme, partnering with UK charity Hubbub to connect the 7 million people in the UK without internet access through their 'Rehome Your Phone' initiative. Plus, for every phone rehomed, reboxed plants trees to help offset the device's lifetime Co2 emissions, all thanks to their partnership with Ecologi.

The Change We Seek	

In spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function.

Echale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

Our 'signature experiences' enable travellers to make a meaningful connection with their destination, our ‘tip-inclusive’ concept guarantees fairness and respect for our guides, and we invest in carbon capture projects in Asia that also regenerate ocean health, protect biodiversity and foster sustainable tourism.

Each of our holidays also includes an element of 'giveback' to maximise its positive impact.  This might be a meal at a social enterprise restaurant, a  visit to a homestay or an element of community-based tourism.

The agency was born out of a desire to design for clients who were passionate about their product or service. Whatever the organisation might do, we found that if the client had an energy, a drive and self-belief to deliver their message through whatever media, then Wild Dog can capture that magic.

Since Wild Dog was founded it has always believed in purpose as well as profit. We were co-founders and active members of the AITO Act on Climate Crisis Think Tank as well as being co-signatories and launch partners of the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. 

As far as we know we’re the only agency of our kind that commits to donating a percentage of our sales revenue (not profit!) to charities, supporting a local homeless charity, a global animal welfare charity, and an environmental charity. Any client we work with gets to choose which charity they would like to contribute to.

As Africa’s largest rent-to-own solar service provider by capacity installed, Mobisol is paving the way for the solar revolution in the developing world by delivering a clean, affordable alternative to fossil fuels for low-income households living without access to reliable energy.

The Mobisol Product-Service-Offer

Mobisol’s products are made affordable by a rent-to-own scheme offering micro-finance loans over a period of 36 months in small, flexible installments payable via Mobile Money. Mobisol solar systems come complete with an extended warranty and a full service package including comprehensive customer service, free maintenance and an innovative remote monitoring technology. The systems can illuminate entire households, and power (e.g.) laptops, radios, TVs, fridges and charge cell phones - and are powerful enough to run energy-based businesses.

Mobisol’s Impact

Mobisol has so far electrified over 50,000 households in East Africa and has installed more than 5MW solar capacity. Over 250,000 indirect beneficiaries are profiting from an electrification infrastructure made possible by Mobisol. The company has so far employed about 400 full-time employees and empowered over 600 small entrepreneurs working as contractors, with over 90% of the team working in Tanzania and Rwanda. The Mobisol Akademie trains and certifies all customer-facing staff and has so far trained over 900 people. Mobisol has shown a strong and stable growth track record since 3 years and has, among other acclaimed recognitions, recently been awarded the UNFCCC’s Momentum for Change Award 2015.

Mobisol has long striven to be a socially responsible business with the clear aim to empower communities in developing nations with affordable, reliable and clean solar energy. To emphasize our commitment to sustainable socioeconomic and ecological development, we have now become a certified B Corp – a designation that combines social and environmental responsibility and bottom-line profitability.

Mobisol is happy to join a community and worldwide movement of companies who strive to not only be profitable, but, mostly, to meet preassigned standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. While of course all B Corps operate under varying circumstances and in differing nations, fields and industries and serve different end goals, we strongly support this move forward to a creation of a worldwide set of values in regards to social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.

The Change We Seek	

Mobisol seeks to change the way we think about worldwide energy provision – the fossil fuel energy paradigm is ecologically suicidal, expensive and does not deliver electricity to the world’s poor. Mobisol strives to provide clean, affordable energy to great parts of the approximately 2.5 billion people worldwide that live without a reliable electricity source to fill their daily energy needs. Millions of households currently manage to subsist using kerosene lanterns, diesel generators and other fossil sources that are unhealthy, harmful to the environment – and very costly. Mobisol’s electrification model protects the environment, mitigates climate change and currently offsets approximately 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year by substituting fossil fuels.

Mobisol seeks to greatly increase rural communities’ standard of living and to help achieve global (energy) equality by leapfrogging the non-existing electricity grid and replacing the usage of fossil fuels-based energy. Owning their personal electricity source has a positive socio-economic impact on low-income households. Efficient, bright LED bulbs and longer light hours increase family productivity. Using solar technology, customers are able to work in the evening and children have light to do their homework thereby improving education levels. Additionally, rural entrepreneurs are empowered as they earn incremental income running energy-based businesses such as charging mobile phones and solar lanterns, running barber salons or operating village cinemas.

With the “Mobisol Akademie” concept, Mobisol seeks to further capacity building and job generation in developing nations. The Mobisol Akademie was established in 2014 to train local entrepreneurs working as Mobisol technicians and sales staff to effectively service customers, while supporting sustainable growth.",Electrical equipment,Wholesale,Solar home systems & appliances including microfinance option & customer service,Germany,Berlin,"Berlin (w/ projects in Tanzania, Rwanda)",Wholesale/Retail, 50-249,bcorporation.net/directory/mobisol,www.plugintheworld.com,2015,146.9,16.6,58.9,48.7,7.3,12.8,0,0,1.4,0,1.2,1.8,,,,1.6,,4.9,,2.5,,,,,,5.7,,,,29.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5,,4.4,,,,3.2,28.6,,,,,1.6,,,0.9,,0.2,1.6,2.3,2.1,,,2.7,,,,,,0.6,1.3,2.1,4.7,,1.3,,1

Each self-catering house is presented with something special and quirky enough to tempt people away from flying and into staycations. Under 45% of holiday houses are accepted into the business. 

The brand focuses on redefining 'luxury' away from 1980's ideals and into a modern, integral meaning, including the basics: local, and seasonal. Inspiring 'education touch-points' are crafted into all communications to encourage people into future-focused, climate-friendly behaviours. 
Owners are encouraged to green-up their houses and support local businesses. Guests are encouraged to immerse themselves in the slow/local life, embrace nature, and support sustainability-goals on their travels. The brand gives particular emphasis to inspiring people through story-telling; interviewing local food heroes and spending-green.

 Opaline’s juices are made exclusively from freshly pressed fruits and vegetables, sourced from local farmers. No concentrates. No preservatives. No colorings. Just a pure juice, just as nature intended it to be. Today, Opaline can be seen in over 900 retailers in Switzerland, from café-restaurants-hotels to hospitals and schools and of course, grocery stores.
 
 It all began in a kitchen back in 2010, testing recipes and developing ideas on how to contribute to the safeguard of local agriculture. In 2011, Opaline invested in a small-scale fruit juice production line and started selling its products locally. Sales grew rapidly and the company transferred its production to a larger facility, powered by the solar energy.
 
 Opaline has a “fair price” policy on all its needs in fruits and vegetables. It is also managed on a linear system, where all those involved in the development are considered as an essential part and thus treated equally.
