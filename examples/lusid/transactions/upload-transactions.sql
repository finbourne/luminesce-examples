-- Description:
-- 1. In this query, we run an ETL process on some transactions.
-- 2. First, we load a XML file of transactions from Drive.
-- 3. Next, we transform the shape of the transaction data.
-- 4. Finally we upload the transaction data into LUSID.

-- ============================================================

-- Extract transaction data from LUSID Drive
@txn_data = 
use Drive.Xml

TransactionDate=transactionDate
SettlementDate=settlementDate
Units=units
Price=price
TotalConsideration=totalConsideration
Currency=price/@currency
ClientInternal=clientInternal
enduse;

-- Set variables for the portfolio's scope and code
@@portfolio_scope =
select 'IBOR';

@@portfolio_code =
select 'uk-equity';

--Transform data using SQL
@transactions = 
select
